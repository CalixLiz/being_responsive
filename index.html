                    as the data owner. Just like the Scribe Rule marked timbers
                    hide their ultimate form prior to reaching their assembly
                    point, your data remains indiscernible to anyone without the

                    hackers. In other words, like the timbers, your data will
                    not be transformed into its ultimate form without your keys…

                    Roomored is disrupting the new construction residential real
                    estate market with its cutting edge photo real Virtual
                    Reality platform. A new home is the most expensive purchase
                    we will make in our lifetime, and until now; decisions are
                    made with very few visuals – the home building process is
                    ambiguous and anxiety ridden. Roomored’s virtual floor plans
                    provide a cost-effective, time-saving alternative to home
                    builders throughout North America.
